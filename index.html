Make your own step-by-step guide
================================

This template allows you to build a more advanced step-by-step guide.
The example theme here is for you to change as much as you like to
create appearance and content which are truly your own.

READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of
this for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but
instead are just text comments about the code. For this project, the
comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing
the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding
of what you are being asked to do.

GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like
this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information
contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side
of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

IN THIS CHALLENGE, YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT:

- HTML: Nested lists
- HTML: Unordered list
- HTML: Captions
- CSS: Borders
- CSS: Embedding images and videos

              <h3>Post photos of yourself that you consider to be professional</h3>
              <p>These photos do not need to be professionally taken, and they don't even need to be professional headshots - though they should be for your profile photo if it is a LinkedIn or business account - but they should be appropriate and generally professional. Use editing software like Adobe Photoshop to clean up the background or enhance the image. And make sure that all images are appropriate. Would you want your mom or boss to see this image? If not, then you probably shouldn't post it.</p>

              <h3>Post statements you'd feel comfortable sharing with your boss or clients in person</h3>
              <p>It's easy to get lost in the toxic twittersphere and lose yourself to your intrusive thoughts. However, it's also extremely common nowadays for employers to look at a potential hire's social media accounts to make sure that they are appropriate and are who they say they are. Therefore, if you wouldn't say something at work to your boss or coworkers, then you probably shouldn't put it on social media, either. Make sure that your online presence is an accurate reflection of who you are in real life, too.

              <p>Although it's great to connect with your friends on social media, it's important to remember that not everybody is focussed on keeping their accounts professional, including our close friends. Look at your social media account from the viewpoint of an employer, and if a friend's inappropriate reposts or comments appear on your feed, you may want to delete them.</p>

              <h3>Never comment about work online</h3>
              <p>It's a good rule of thumb to not talk about work on any of your social media accounts - whether the statement you're making is good or bad. Future employers won't want to hire you if they think that there is a possibility you will trash talk their company, and current employers don't want promotions or demotions to come from their employees, but rather from their customers. Keep your work life private.

              <p>I know, I know, it's been ingrained into our heads since the dawn of the iPhone. But it really is important for much more than safety. Employers or bosses can see who you follow and who you are mutuals with. Although it is important to make numerous connections, it is also important to ensure that those connections are credible and professional. Although following celebrities and other companies is OK, it's important not to make the wrong connections.</p>

              <p>Although it does not seem like the most important step, it is something that not a lot of people think about. Especially on professional or business accounts, it never hurts to flex your knowledge and show everyone that you can be professional and clear in every day life, not just at work.</p>
